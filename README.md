# ROS configuration and launch files for Neobotix MM-400

This package contains configuration and launch files for Neobotix MP-400.

The [MM-400](https://www.neobotix-robots.com/mobile-manipulator-mm-400.html) combines the mobile robot MP-400 and a light-weight robot arm from PILZ or Schunk to create a very compact and agile robot system for research applications.

Its small footprint makes the MM-400 perfect for use in narrow environments where other robots cannot navigate.
